## Deals Don't Die From Competition

Cadence is a free CRM and sales workflow tool for small businesses. After watching hundreds of small teams use it, we've noticed a pattern: the deals that fall through almost never lose to a competitor. They lose to silence.

A lead goes quiet. You forget to follow up. A week passes. Then two. By the time you circle back, they've already hired someone else — or worse, solved the problem themselves in a way that didn't involve you.

The fix isn't more features. It's three daily habits.

## 1. Check Your Overdue Tasks (2 Minutes)

Every morning, open your CRM and look at one thing: **tasks that are past due.**

These are the follow-ups you promised, the proposals you were supposed to send, the check-ins you scheduled. If they're overdue, that means someone is waiting on you — or has stopped waiting.

**What to do:**

- Complete them immediately if possible
- Reschedule if you can't (but be honest about why)
- Delete if they're no longer relevant (dead deals happen)

This single habit takes two minutes and eliminates the biggest source of lost revenue for small teams: the forgotten follow-up.

## 2. Look at Your Idle Deals (3 Minutes)

An idle deal is one that hasn't had any activity in 7+ days. No calls, no emails, no notes, no stage changes. Just sitting there.

Idle doesn't mean dead. But it means you've lost momentum — and momentum is everything in a small sales cycle.

**What to do:**

- Pick the top 2–3 idle deals
- Send a short follow-up message (even "Hi — still interested?" works)
- Add a note: what you sent, what you're waiting for
- If a deal has been idle for 14+ days with no response, consider moving it to lost — or at minimum, deprioritizing it

A clean pipeline is an honest pipeline. Keeping zombie deals around inflates your forecast and hides your real numbers.

## 3. Add a Note to Your Most Important Deal (1 Minute)

Pick the deal closest to closing. Add a note. It can be one sentence:

- "Client confirmed budget. Sending contract tomorrow."
- "Waiting on approval from their partner."
- "They asked about timeline — responded with availability."

Why? Because future-you will forget today's context. When you come back to this deal in 3 days, that note will immediately tell you where things stand without re-reading email threads or trying to remember a phone conversation.

This is the simplest habit in CRM and the one with the highest return. It takes 30 seconds and saves 10 minutes of confusion later.

## Why These Three?

These habits work because they target the three primary failure modes of small-team sales:

| Failure Mode | Habit | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Forgotten follow-up | Check overdue tasks | 2 min |
| Lost momentum | Review idle deals | 3 min |
| Lost context | Add a note | 1 min |

**Total: 6 minutes per day.**

No spreadsheet tracking. No weekly review meetings. No complex reporting dashboards. Just a short daily check-in that keeps your pipeline moving.

## The Compound Effect

The power of these habits isn't in any single day. It's in the compound effect.

After one week: you've followed up on every overdue task and nudged every stale deal.

After one month: your pipeline accuracy improves dramatically. You know exactly what's real and what's dead.

After three months: your close rate goes up — not because you got better at selling, but because you stopped letting deals slip through the cracks.

**Sales hygiene isn't a strategy. It's a practice.** And the best CRM is the one that makes that practice so easy you don't have to think about it.
