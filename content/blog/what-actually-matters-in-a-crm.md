## Features Don't Equal Value

Cadence is a free CRM and sales workflow tool built for small businesses. We spent a lot of time studying how solo operators and small teams actually use CRMs — not how vendors say they should be used.

The gap is enormous.

Most CRM marketing pages list 50+ features. Most users interact with 5 of them. The other 45 create noise, clutter, and cognitive overhead that makes the tool harder to stick with.

Here's what actually matters.

## 1. A Contact List That's Easy to Maintain

This sounds obvious, but it's where most CRMs fail first.

A contact list needs to be:

- **Fast to add to** — One click, minimal fields, no friction
- **Easy to search** — By name, email, company, or tag
- **Connected** — Tied to deals, tasks, and activity automatically
- **Clean** — Duplicates are manageable, merges are possible

If adding a contact takes more than 10 seconds, you'll stop doing it. And a CRM with incomplete data is worse than a spreadsheet — because at least the spreadsheet doesn't pretend to be comprehensive.

## 2. A Pipeline You Actually Look At

Your deal pipeline is the single most important view in a CRM. It should show you:

- **What's active** — How many deals are in progress
- **What needs attention** — Which deals have been idle
- **What's close to closing** — Where your revenue is coming from

The best pipeline view is a Kanban board. Columns for each stage. Cards for each deal. Drag to move forward.

That's it. No nested sub-stages. No probability scoring you'll never calibrate. No mandatory fields that block you from moving a card.

A pipeline should feel like a to-do list for your revenue.

## 3. Tasks That Are Tied to Context

Standalone task managers (Todoist, Asana, Notion) are great — but they lack context.

A CRM task is powerful because it knows:

- **Who** it's about (contact)
- **What** it relates to (deal)
- **When** it's due
- **Why** it exists (follow-up, proposal, onboarding)

This means you can look at a contact and see every pending action. You can look at a deal and see what's blocking progress. You can open your task list and immediately know the business context behind each item.

Tasks without context are just items on a list. Tasks with context drive deals forward.

## 4. An Activity Log You Don't Have to Think About

Every CRM evangelist says "log your activities." Very few people actually do it consistently, because manual logging is tedious.

The best activity log is the one that builds itself:

- Contact created → logged
- Deal moved to next stage → logged
- Task completed → logged
- Note added → logged

You shouldn't have to think about recording your history. The system should do it as a byproduct of your normal workflow. Then, when you need to review what happened with a client, the timeline is already there.

## What Doesn't Matter (For Most Small Teams)

Here's the controversial part. These features are frequently marketed as essential but rarely used by teams under 5 people:

- **Email tracking** — Opens and clicks are vanity metrics for small teams
- **Lead scoring** — You know who your hot leads are. You don't need an algorithm.
- **Sales forecasting** — Requires months of clean data to be meaningful
- **Custom fields everywhere** — Flexibility is good; infinite customization is a time sink
- **Mobile apps** — Responsive web works fine until you're truly field-based

We're not saying these features are bad. They're powerful in the right context. But if you're choosing a CRM and these features are the deciding factor, you're probably optimizing for the wrong thing.

## The Litmus Test

Here's a simple test for any CRM:

> Can you open it in the morning, know exactly who to follow up with, and close it in under 5 minutes?

If yes, it's working. If it takes longer than that just to orient yourself, the tool is getting in the way.

A CRM should reduce the time between "I should do something" and actually doing it. Everything else is decoration.
