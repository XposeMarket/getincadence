## You Don't Have a Salesforce Problem

Cadence is a free CRM and sales workflow tool for small businesses. We built it because we kept seeing the same pattern: a small team signs up for Salesforce, HubSpot, or Pipedrive, spends weeks configuring it, and quietly stops using it within a month.

The tool wasn't broken. It was just built for someone else.

## Enterprise Software Solves Enterprise Problems

Salesforce is an incredible product — for companies with dedicated sales ops teams, complex approval workflows, and thousands of contacts flowing through multi-stage funnels. It was designed for that world.

But if you're a photographer managing 15 active bookings, or a consultant running a pipeline of 8 deals, you don't need:

- Custom objects and record types
- Workflow automation builders with 40-step logic chains
- Role hierarchies and territory management
- A $25–$300/user/month price tag

You need to know who to follow up with today. That's it.

## The Hidden Cost of Overbuilt Tools

The real cost isn't the subscription. It's the time you spend managing the tool instead of doing the work.

Every hour spent configuring fields, building reports you'll never read, or watching tutorial videos is an hour you could have spent:

- Following up with a warm lead
- Closing a deal that's been sitting idle
- Actually doing the work your client is paying for

**Complexity has a compounding cost.** The more features a tool has, the more decisions you make before you can use it. And for small teams, those decisions are the bottleneck — not the lack of features.

## What You Actually Need

Most small businesses need a CRM that does five things well:

1. **Track contacts** — Know who your people are and how you met them
2. **Manage deals** — See what's in your pipeline and what needs attention
3. **Create tasks** — Never forget a follow-up
4. **Log activity** — Keep a history without thinking about it
5. **Stay out of the way** — Open it, do the thing, close it

That's it. No dashboards with 14 widgets. No AI-generated forecasts for a team of two. No onboarding wizard that takes 45 minutes.

## When Does Salesforce Make Sense?

To be fair, there are real scenarios where Salesforce (or a comparable enterprise CRM) is the right call:

- You have 20+ salespeople who need territory management
- Your sales cycle is 6+ months with multiple stakeholders
- You need deep integrations with ERP, marketing automation, and support tools
- You have a full-time admin who manages the system

If that's you, Salesforce is great. Go for it.

But if you're a team of 1–5 people running a service business, freelance practice, or small consultancy — you're paying for someone else's complexity.

## A CRM Should Match Your Workflow

The best CRM is the one you actually use. If your current tool feels heavy, that's not a discipline problem. It's a fit problem.

Small businesses deserve tools that respect their time. Not every workflow needs to be automated. Not every interaction needs to be scored. Sometimes you just need a clean list of who to call today and a way to move a deal forward.

This is the kind of simplicity Cadence was designed around — a CRM that works the way small teams actually work, without the overhead of tools built for a different scale entirely.
