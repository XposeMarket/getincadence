## Spreadsheets Are Great. Seriously.

Cadence is a free CRM and sales workflow tool for small businesses. But we'll be the first to admit: a spreadsheet is a perfectly legitimate way to manage your contacts and deals when you're starting out.

Google Sheets or Excel can handle:

- A list of 20 contacts with phone numbers and notes
- A simple pipeline tracker with columns for each stage
- A to-do list for follow-ups

There's no setup. No learning curve. No subscription. If you have 10 clients and a simple workflow, a spreadsheet might be all you need — and anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to sell you something.

So when do spreadsheets stop working?

## The Five Signs You've Outgrown Your Spreadsheet

### 1. You've Forgotten to Follow Up (More Than Once)

Spreadsheets don't remind you of anything. There are no due dates. No notifications. No overdue indicators. Tasks live in your memory, and memory is unreliable.

If you've lost a deal because you forgot to send a proposal or follow up on a call, the spreadsheet didn't fail you — it just couldn't help you. It's a static list, not a workflow tool.

### 2. You're Scrolling Instead of Searching

When your spreadsheet has 50+ rows, finding someone becomes an exercise in scrolling, squinting, and hoping your naming convention was consistent. Was it "John Smith" or "Smith, John"? Did you put the company name in column C or D?

A CRM has search. Real search. Type a name, email, or keyword and find everything associated with that person instantly.

### 3. You Can't See Your Pipeline at a Glance

A spreadsheet pipeline is a list. A CRM pipeline is a visual board.

The difference matters when you need to answer: "How many deals do I have in the proposal stage?" In a spreadsheet, you have to filter or scan. In a Kanban-style pipeline, you just look.

Visual tools reduce the time between question and answer. When your pipeline gets complex enough that glancing at it doesn't give you clarity, the spreadsheet has hit its limit.

### 4. You've Duplicated or Lost Data

Spreadsheets are single-layer. There's no concept of a "contact" that links to a "deal" that links to "tasks" and "activity."

So what happens? You duplicate data across tabs. The client's phone number is in the contacts tab, the deals tab, and a notes document. When something changes, you update one and forget the others.

A CRM is relational. Update a contact's phone number once, and it's reflected everywhere — in their profile, in every deal, in every task.

### 5. You Can't Share It Without Breaking It

The moment a second person needs access, spreadsheets become dangerous. Conflicting edits. Accidentally deleted rows. Conditional formatting that breaks. Version confusion.

A CRM is multi-user by design. Everyone sees the same data. Changes are tracked. Nothing gets accidentally overwritten.

## What You Lose by Staying Too Long

The cost of an outgrown spreadsheet isn't obvious. It's not a single catastrophic event — it's a slow accumulation of:

- **30 seconds** looking for a contact you should've found instantly
- **2 minutes** trying to remember where you left off with a lead
- **5 minutes** updating three tabs when one field changes
- **1 lost deal** because a follow-up fell through the cracks

Over a month, that's hours of wasted time and real revenue left on the table. Not because you're disorganized — because the tool doesn't have the structure your workflow needs.

## What to Look For in a Spreadsheet Replacement

When you're ready to move past spreadsheets, you don't need something complicated. You need something that:

- **Imports your data** — Don't start from scratch
- **Feels equally simple** — If it's harder to use than a spreadsheet, you won't switch
- **Adds structure, not friction** — Linked contacts, deals, and tasks without 200 configuration options
- **Starts free** — You shouldn't have to pay just to find out if a CRM works for you

The goal isn't to adopt a "system." The goal is to stop losing time and deals to the limitations of a flat file.

## The Right Time to Switch

There's no universal trigger. But if you've nodded along to two or more of the signs above, you've already outgrown your spreadsheet — you just haven't made the switch yet.

The good news: switching from a spreadsheet to a simple CRM takes about 15 minutes. Import your contacts, set up a pipeline, and you're running. The habits transfer. The data transfers. The only thing that changes is that the tool starts working *with* you instead of making you do all the work.
